        Emacs-wget USAGE  ($Date: 2005/09/16 03:53:25 $)

This document describes HOW-TO use emacs-wget.

1. wget commands

1.1. M-x wget

     The most fundamental command for download.

     Input URL of the file which you want to download.  Retrieved
     file(s) will go to ~/download.

     Called with prefix argument (C-u), emacs-wget asks wget options and
     destination directory.  Emacs-wget support completion for long
     options.  Type TAB in the prompt for completing; SPACE is not for
     completion, but a separator of options.

     *CAUTION*: Old GNU wget does not support long type options.  Check
      your wget accepting long option.  Anyway, completion list is
      created along the info file of GNU wget v.1.8.2, so some options
      are not supported in your wget.

1.2. M-x wget-web-page

     Download file from URL and all pages linked to it.

     With prefix argument (C-u), ask wget options and where to save
     referring file.

1.3. M-x wget-quit

     Terminate wget process.  If multiple download processes are
     proceeding, choose one of them with completion.

     Emacs-wget provides *wget* buffer, easy way to terminate wget
     process.


2. *wget* buffer

   A buffer as below will open when the emacs-wget starts download.  It
   is called as *wget* buffer.  *wget* buffer displays the current state
   of downloading.

      ==== *wget* ======== (wget) ======================================

   In *wget* buffer, some keys are pre-defined.  Key bindings are as
   followings:

     key   Operation
    ----- -----------
      d    Kill the wget process under the cursor.
      q    Hide *wget* buffer (Wget process is still alive in background.)
      Q    Quit all wget processes and kill *wget* buffer.
      g    Revert *wget* buffer display.
      i    Update information for wget process under the cursor.
      n    To the next wget process.
      p    To the previous wget process.
    ----- -----------


3. Cooperation with web browser on Emacs

   Emacs/W3 and Emacs-w3m are web browser on Emacs.

   Emacs/W3:
     http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html

   Emacs-w3m:
     http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/

   Setting c-1. in README file substitutes the command for download from
   Emacs-w3m default command (w3m-download-this-url) to emacs-wget
   (w3m-wget).

   Setting c-2. in README file adds new command for download (w3-wget).
   Set command your favourite key.  I can not start up Emacs/W3 now, so
   please tell me how to substitute key like Emacs-w3m.


4. Customization

   This section explains the user variables.  You can change them using
   custom package.  The line next to variable name is the default value.

4.1. wget-command
     "wget"

     Program name of `wget'. If wget command is not in PATH, set it
     using absolute path.

4.2. wget-download-directory
     "~/download"

     Directory name thet retrieved file(s) will go.

4.3. wget-default-options
     nil

     List of default wget options.

     See your info file of wget for more informaiton.

4.4. wget-web-page-options
     '("-r" "-L" "-np")

     List of default wget options when download all web pages.
     wget-web-page-options takes over the value of wget-default-options
     until setting the value explicitly.

     See your info file of wget for more informaiton.

4.5. wget-ftp-default-options
     nil

     List of wget options when download from FTP site.  If nil, use
     wget-default-options instead.

     This is an example to download using --passive-ftp option from FTP:

       (add-hook 'wget-load-hook
                 (lambda ()
	           (setq wget-ftp-default-options
                         (append wget-default-options '("--passive-ftp")))))

4.6. wget-hook
     nil

     A hook run after emacs-wget commands are called.

4.7. wget-load-hook

     A hook run after loading wget.el.

4.8. wget-process-buffer

     If nil, do not display *wget* buffer.
